## Pet project to show some architecture approaches.

What was used:

- Multi-module approach
- Clean architecture
- [Moxy](https://github.com/Arello-Mobile/Moxy) for MVP
- [Epoxy](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy) for lists
- [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
- [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
- Written fully on Kotlin
- Retrofit
- etc.

What is to be done:

- Move all routing to [Cicerone](https://github.com/terrakok/Cicerone)
- Try coroutines
- Try [Toothpick](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/toothpick) for DI
- Try Redux(MVI, etc.)
- Maybe some UI improvements. (just make it nicer)
